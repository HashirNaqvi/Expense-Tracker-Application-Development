**Project Title: Expense Tracker Application Development**

**Project Description:**


The Expense Tracker Application is a full-stack web application designed to help users efficiently manage their finances by tracking expenses and income. This project emphasizes seamless user interaction, data persistence, and a visually appealing user interface. The application allows users to register, log in, and perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on their financial records, categorizing them into various expense or income types.
This project incorporates the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) stack, leveraging each component for a modern, scalable, and user-friendly solution. Postman was used extensively for API testing and debugging, ensuring smooth integration between the backend and frontend systems.

**Key Features:**


•	User Registration and Login System with Validation.
•	Secure handling of passwords and user authentication.
•	Dynamic UI for ease of use.
•	Responsive design for accessibility across various devices.

**Technologies Used:**

**1.	Frontend:**

o	React.js: For building the user interface with reusable components.
o	React Icons: For adding intuitive and visually engaging icons.
o	Tailwind CSS/Bootstrap: For responsive and aesthetic design.

**2.	Backend:**

o	Node.js: Server-side runtime for handling application logic.
o	Express.js: Framework for creating RESTful APIs and routing.

**3.	Database:**

o	MongoDB: For storing user data and financial records in a scalable NoSQL database.
**4.	Tools:**

o	Postman: For testing and debugging APIs to ensure reliability.
o	Axios: For making HTTP requests between the frontend and backend.

**5.	State Management:**

o	React Query: For efficient data fetching and caching.

**6.	Validation:**

o	Yup and Formik: For client-side form validation and handling.

**7.	Authentication & Security:**

o	JWT (JSON Web Tokens): For user authentication and secure session handling.
o	Bcrypt.js: For hashing and securing user passwords.

**8.	Version Control:**

o	Git: For managing the codebase and version control.
o	GitHub: For project collaboration and repository hosting.

**Development Workflow:**

•	Designed the UI using Figma  before implementing it with React.
•	Set up the backend using Node.js and Express.js, integrating with MongoDB for data storage.
•	Tested API endpoints with Postman to ensure smooth frontend-backend communication.
•	Implemented user authentication with JWT and password hashing using Bcrypt.js.
•	Styled the application with Tailwind CSS/Bootstrap for a modern and responsive design.
•	Deployed the application on a cloud platform (if applicable) for public accessibility.
Outcome:
The Expense Tracker Application provides a reliable and scalable solution for tracking personal finances. It combines modern web technologies to offer an intuitive experience, ensuring data security, fast performance, and ease of use. This project showcases expertise in full-stack development using the MERN stack and highlights the ability to integrate and test various tools and technologies effectively.
